      "arxiv_id": "2503.04153v1",
      "abstract": "Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires\nlocalized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical\nreasoning capabilities. Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based\nLLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical\nexpertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge.\nRetrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and\nclinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating\nthree technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nopen-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2)\nMedical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and\nintelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep)\nemploying agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical\ndocuments. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage\nmedical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical\nexpertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam\nquestions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1%\nover baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining\nrobustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative\ncase studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL)\ndemonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query.\nKidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure\ndocumentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new\nframework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system\nsignificantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability,\nenabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs\nconveniently.",

      "arxiv_id": "2502.16696v1",
      "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4,\nBART, and LLaMA, the need for a system that can intelligently select the most\nsuitable model for specific tasks while balancing cost, latency, accuracy, and\nethical considerations has become increasingly important. Recognizing that not\nall tasks necessitate models with over 100 billion parameters, we introduce\nOptiRoute, an advanced model routing engine designed to dynamically select and\nroute tasks to the optimal LLM based on detailed user-defined requirements.\nOptiRoute captures both functional (e.g., accuracy, speed, cost) and\nnon-functional (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty) criteria, leveraging\nlightweight task analysis and complexity estimation to efficiently match tasks\nwith the best-fit models from a diverse array of LLMs. By employing a hybrid\napproach combining k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search and hierarchical filtering,\nOptiRoute optimizes for user priorities while minimizing computational\noverhead. This makes it ideal for real-time applications in cloud-based ML\nplatforms, personalized AI services, and regulated industries.",

      "title": "QUAD-LLM-MLTC: Large Language Models Ensemble Learning for Healthcare Text Multi-Label Classification",
      "arxiv_id": "2502.14189v2",
      "abstract": "The escalating volume of collected healthcare textual data presents a unique\nchallenge for automated Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC), which is\nprimarily due to the scarcity of annotated texts for training and their nuanced\nnature. Traditional machine learning models often fail to fully capture the\narray of expressed topics. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable effectiveness across numerous Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks in various domains, which show impressive computational\nefficiency and suitability for unsupervised learning through prompt\nengineering. Consequently, these LLMs promise an effective MLTC of medical\nnarratives. However, when dealing with various labels, different prompts can be\nrelevant depending on the topic. To address these challenges, the proposed\napproach, QUAD-LLM-MLTC, leverages the strengths of four LLMs: GPT-4o, BERT,\nPEGASUS, and BART. QUAD-LLM-MLTC operates in a sequential pipeline in which\nBERT extracts key tokens, PEGASUS augments textual data, GPT-4o classifies, and\nBART provides topics' assignment probabilities, which results in four\nclassifications, all in a 0-shot setting. The outputs are then combined using\nensemble learning and processed through a meta-classifier to produce the final\nMLTC result. The approach is evaluated using three samples of annotated texts,\nwhich contrast it with traditional and single-model methods. The results show\nsignificant improvements across the majority of the topics in the\nclassification's F1 score and consistency (F1 and Micro-F1 scores of 78.17% and\n80.16% with standard deviations of 0.025 and 0.011, respectively). This\nresearch advances MLTC using LLMs and provides an efficient and scalable\nsolution to rapidly categorize healthcare-related text data without further\ntraining.",

      "arxiv_id": "2502.05825v1",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in natural\nlanguage processing but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually\nincorrect or fabricated content. This issue undermines their reliability,\nparticularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and legal advisory. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Delta, an inference-time method that reduces\nhallucinations without requiring model retraining or additional data. Delta\nworks by randomly masking parts of the input prompt and contrasting the output\ndistributions for the original and masked inputs, effectively suppressing\nhallucinations through inference-only computations. We evaluate Delta on\ncontext-rich question-answering benchmarks, achieving absolute improvements of\napproximately 3 and 6 percentage points on SQuAD v1.1 and v2, respectively, and\n7 and 2 percentage points on TriviaQA and Natural Questions under-sampling\ndecoding. Delta also improves the no-answer exact match score on SQuAD v2 by\nover ten percentage points, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating\nhallucinations arising from contextual ambiguity. These results highlight Delta\nas a computationally efficient and scalable approach for improving the\nreliability of LLMs in real-world applications.",

      "title": "Multimodal AI predicts clinical outcomes of drug combinations from preclinical data",
      "arxiv_id": "2503.02781v1",
      "abstract": "Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for\nidentifying safe and effective drug combinations. Current models rely on\nstructural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity\ndrug combinations. However, these approaches fail to incorporate the multimodal\ndata necessary for accurate, clinically-relevant predictions. Here, we\nintroduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway,\ncell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects\nacross 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of\napproved drugs and novel compounds in development. MADRIGAL uses a transformer\nbottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling\nmissing data during training and inference--a major challenge in multimodal\nlearning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in\npredicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of\nanticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II\ndiabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It\nidentifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts\nresmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with\nthe most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by\nintegrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid\nleukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy\nof personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language\nmodel allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving\nsafety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity\nrisks. MADRIGAL provides a multimodal approach for designing combination\ntherapies with improved predictive accuracy and clinical relevance.",
